Solar Panels are a critical resource for space stations. Solar cells are used to directly convert sunlight to electricity. 
Large numbers of cells are assembled in arrays to produce high power levels. This method of harnessing solar power is called photovoltaics. 
Since space stations are often not in direct sunlight, it relies on rechargeable nickel-hydrogen batteries to provide continuous power during 
the "eclipse" part of the orbit.

The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, in July 1975, was the first joint U.S.-Soviet space flight, and the last flight of an Apollo spacecraft. Its primary 
purpose was as a symbol of the policy of detente that the two superpowers were pursuing at the time, and marked the end of the Space Race between them 
that began in 1957. The ApolloSoyuz Test Project entailed the docking of an American Apollo spacecraft with the then-Soviet Soyuz spacecraft.

Mir was a space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001, at first by the Soviet Union and then by Russia. Assembled in orbit from 1986 
to 1996, Mir was the first modular space station and had a greater mass than that of any previous spacecraft, holding the record for the largest artificial 
satellite orbiting the Earth. Mir served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, 
astronomy, meteorology and spacecraft systems in order to develop technologies required for the permanent occupation of space.

The International Space Station (ISS) is a habitable artificial satellite in low Earth orbit. The ISS is a modular structure whose first component was 
launched in 1998. The ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components. Like many artificial satellites, the 
station can be seen with the naked eye from Earth without any special equipment.
